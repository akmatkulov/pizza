<p>The Pizza Shop is old-school, yes, but not old-fashioned. Recipes that have been in the family for generations have been carefully reimagined. Familiar dishes including our pizza, pasta, and wings have been done a little differently, given new, enticing twists. And, as always, the freshest local ingredients are used in all of our dishes, from entrees to our farm-fresh salads, whenever possible. Even our ice cream is handmade in small batches in the Hudson Valley using hormone-free New York State milk and Cream.<p>
